could not get mysql to start properly despite numerous attempts.
I seem to be having better luck with postgres, which I have never used before.

sudo apt-get install python-pygresql

sudo -u postgres psql postgres

postgres=# \q

sudo -u postgres createdb django

postgress install was a bit painful, but successful
