Use MYSQL... That is what the assignment is 
sitename note (internal time stamp)

the sitename should have an id...
that will be one model (also timestamp)

second model... 
id + note + timestamp

future models:

details about each site
plug in a monitoring system.
Basically, turn the site into a Work Interface
